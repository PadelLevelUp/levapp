# classes.edit


### Intent
Edit a class or a specific instance. Supports editing single occurrences or all future occurrences of a recurring class.

### Rules
1. `PATCH /api/app/class/{lesson_id}` edits the parent lesson template
2. `PATCH /api/app/lesson_instance/{instance_id}` edits a specific instance
3. Scope parameter: `single` (just this occurrence) or `future` (this and all future)
4. Instance edits create overridden fields tracked in `overridden_fields` JSON
5. Changing lesson time reschedules all future reminder/invitation jobs

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Edit single instance
- **Given** a recurring class with an instance on April 20
- **When** coach PATCHes the instance with `{"overwrite_title": "Special Session"}`
- **Then** only the April 20 instance shows "Special Session"
- **And** `overridden_fields` tracks which fields differ from the parent

#### Edit future occurrences
- **Given** a recurring class starting at 10:00
- **When** coach edits with scope `future` to start at 11:00
- **Then** the parent lesson template is updated
- **And** all future instances reflect the new time
