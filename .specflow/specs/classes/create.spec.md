# classes.create


### Intent
Coaches create classes (lessons) that can be one-off or recurring. Classes are the template; instances are the actual scheduled occurrences.

### Entities
- **Lesson** (`lessons`): title, description, start_datetime, end_datetime, is_recurring, recurrence_rule (JSON RRULE), recurrence_end, type (academy|private), default_level_id, max_players, color, status (active|ended), notifications_enabled, club_id
- **Association_CoachLesson** (`coach_in_lesson`): coach_id, lesson_id
- **Association_PlayerLesson** (`player_in_lesson`): player_id, lesson_id

### Rules
1. Type is `academy` (group) or `private` (1-on-1)
2. Recurrence stored as JSON in `recurrence_rule` field (not iCal RRULE string)
3. `recurrence_end` sets when recurring series stops
4. `max_players` caps enrollment
5. Coach and enrolled players are linked via junction tables
6. Creating a lesson with `notifications_enabled=true` schedules reminder jobs
7. **Court (PAD-194).** The payload may carry `courtId`; it must be one of the class's club's courts
   (`clubs.courts` rule 6), else 400 `court_not_in_club`. The court is optional and defaults to none.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Create one-off class
- **Given** an authenticated coach in club 1
- **When** they POST to `/api/app/class` with `{"title": "Monday Beginners", "start_datetime": "2026-04-13T10:00", "end_datetime": "2026-04-13T11:00", "type": "academy", "max_players": 6}`
- **Then** a Lesson record is created with `is_recurring=false`
- **And** a `coach_in_lesson` association is created

#### Create recurring class
- **Given** an authenticated coach
- **When** they POST with `is_recurring=true` and `recurrence_rule={"frequency": "weekly", "daysOfWeek": [1]}`
- **Then** a Lesson record is created with the recurrence config
- **And** reminder jobs are scheduled for the next 60 days of occurrences
