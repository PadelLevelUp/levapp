# messaging.push-notifications


### Intent
Send browser push notifications when a new message arrives and the recipient isn't actively viewing the conversation.

### Rules
1. On message send, `send_push_notification()` called for each recipient
2. Uses VAPID web push (pywebpush library)
3. Notification includes: title (sender name), body (message text), URL (conversation link)
4. Only sent to users with a valid `push_subscriptions` record
5. Native (Expo) message pushes carry `badge` = the recipient's unread message
   total at send time, so the iOS home-screen icon badge matches the in-app
   unread count. The count is the recipient's real total, not an increment, so
   the badge self-corrects after an undelivered push
6. Both clients keep the app-icon badge in sync with the unread count while
   running — iOS via `setBadgeCountAsync`, installed web via the Badging API —
   and clear it on logout. A notification payload is never the only writer of
   the badge: without a client-side writer a stale badge can never be cleared
   (PAD-147)
